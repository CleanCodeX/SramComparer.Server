## Compare S-RAM
Join the exploration team to find meanings for various S-RAM offsets.
This can be done either by using 

* [Web Comparison](comparison)
* [Windows Console App](changelog-console)

### Edit offset values
Once you found a meaning for an offset value, try to enable or disable this flag in other S-RAM (*.srm) files to prove your find. 
Reading and manipulating offset values can be done using the following: 

* [Web Offset Editor](offset-editing)
* [Windows Console App](changelog-console)
* Hex-editor

Post your assumptions and finds in the [Community](community)!

If you're unfamiliar with using the Console App check out the [guides](guides). [Web Comparison](comparison) is easier to use and works with any kind of modern browser.

# Supporting the Project

Finding the meaning of unknown SRAM pieces is a time-consuming journey which needs the help from the community of SoE.

The more people contribute, the earlier and better the results.

But after all this is a free time project and developing tools or finding offset meanings needs hundreds, probably thousands of hours.

## Active Help
If the goals of this project aren't clear yet, make sure to have read through the <a href=goals>goals</a> first.

If you're wondering what can be done to help, there are a few things you can do.

### Comparing SRAMs

If bits and bytes **are** your thing, you could join the exploration team. Check out <a href=contribute>here</a> how it works.

### Provide a localization

Do you speak a language that this website doesn't currently offer but think you think it should be supported? 
In that case, you could consider localization in your language. You could open this project up to people who only understand *your* language.

If you want to do that, check out <a href=localize>here</a> how to proceed.

## Passive Help
If bits and bytes **aren't** your thing, hey no big deal, that's OK.

If you just would like to see a poweful savegame editor in future then you might help with

### Propaganda

In that case you might want to tell your SoE friends about this project. 

Make it publicly known so crowd sourcing can start to kick in.

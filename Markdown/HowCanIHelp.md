## How can I help?

Compare SRAM files. It's not that difficult.

That would be really awesome. This potentially safes  much time not doing ourselfs twice what you already did.

Join the SoE community to find meanings for various SRAM offsets.
This can be done either by using 

* [Web Comparison](compare)
* [Windows Console App](embed?p=downloads)

Once you found a meaning for a offset value, try to enable or disable this flag in other SRAM (*.srm) files to prove your discovery. 
Reading and manipulating offset values can be done either by using  

* [Web Offset Editor](offset)
* [Windows Console App](embed?p=downloads)

Post your discoveries at the [forums](embed?p=forums)!

A manual for using the Console App can be found [here](embed?p=HowToUse).

## How can I help?

Compare SRAM files. It's not difficult at all.

This would be really awesome. This would save much time in not doing something twice what someone else already did.

Join the SoE 'exploration' community to find meanings for various SRAM offsets.
This can be done either by using 

* [Web Comparison](compare)
* [Windows Console App](p?c=downloads)

Once you found a meaning for an offset value, try to enable or disable this flag in other SRAM (*.srm) files to prove your discovery. 
Reading and manipulating offset values can be done using the following: 

* [Web Offset Editor](offset)
* [Windows Console App](p?c=downloads)

Post your assumptions and discoveries in the [Community](p?c=community)!

A manual for using the Console App can be found [here](p?c=HowToUse). [Web Comparison](compare) is easier to use and works with any kind of modern browser.

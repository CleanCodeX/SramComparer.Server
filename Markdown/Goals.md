# Goal

## S-RAM?
If you're unsure what this term means, there is an explanation in the <a href=glossary>glossary</a>.

The S-RAM-file can be read and manipulated, too. So far so good.

The only problem with this is that a bigger area SoE's S-RAM save slot format is still considered to be unknown, meaning that we don't really know what meaning these areas of S-RAM actually have.

### The Unknowns
An explanation of what unknowns are can be found in the <a href=glossary>glossary</a>.
A non-exhaustive list of examples can be found under: <a href=unknowns>Unknowns</a>.

## What are the goals?
Once the S-RAM format is completely known, it offers the possibility to write a full capable S-RAM editor, enabling/disabling everything what can be controlled by a savegame.

"That sounds cool!" you might think. Indeed it does!

### Features of a future savegame editor
* Reset boss fights which have already been defeated
* Specify the in-game save location where you want to continue playing after loading
* Resetting the cancelled ingredients for each map, chapter or the whole game
* Resetting the opened boxes, pots and gourds or walls per map, chapter or the whole game

### When will it be available?

Well, that's mostly up to the amount and quality of contributions by the community.
I am spending my free time working on that, but that won't be enough to make it happen fast.

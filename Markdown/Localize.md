# Localization

Do you speak a language that this website doesn't currently offer but think you think it should be supported? 

## Show / Download Localization
Check out the localization in the bottom area beforehand.

If you want to translate this, download the <a href=localization/csv>CSV file</a> and open it in Excel or any other CSV editor. 
Make sure to not use semicolons (;) as it is used as column a separator.

## Sending
Send the translation <a href="mailto:evermore@SECRETOFxeth.de?Subject=Format%20Exploration%20Projekt">here</a> and removing the SECRETOF part. ;-)

### Localization

Are you speaking a language which this website currently doesn't offer and you think it should support it? 
Then consider providing a localization into your language as a contribution to this project. You might open access to guys who can only understand *your* language.

Have a look at the localization at the bottom. before

If you want to translate that, download the <a href=localization/csv>CSV-file</a> and open it in Excel or any other csv editor. 
Make sure to not use semicola (;) in your translation because it is used as column delimiter.

Submit the translation <a href="mailto:evermore@SECRETOFxeth.de?Subject=Format%20Exploration%20Projekt">here</a> by removing the SECRETOF part. ;-)

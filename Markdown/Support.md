# Supporting the Project

Everyone who is working on this project is dedicated to Secret of Evermore.
Finding the meaning of unknown SRAM pieces is a time-consuming journey which needs the help from the community of SoE.

The more people contribute, the earlier and better results.

But after all this is a free time project and developing tools or finding offset meanings needs hundreds, probably thousands of hours.

## Active Help
If the goal of this project isn't clear, make sure to have read the [goal](p?c=goal) first.

Assuming that you already did that, you might ask yourself what *you* can do.

If you want to join the SoE 'army', see [here](p?c=HowCanIHelp) how it works.

### Passive Help
If that's not yours and just would like to see more capable SRAM editors in future, hey no big deal, that's ok.

In that case you might want to tell your SoE friends about this project. 

Make it publicly known so crowd sourcing can start to kick in.

**Thank you!** 😊

Also **many thanks** to the people who [contributed](p?c=contributors) to this project.

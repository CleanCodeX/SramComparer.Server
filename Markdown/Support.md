# Supporting the Project

Everyone who is working on this project is dedicated to Secret of Evermore.
Finding the meaning of unknown SRAM pieces is a time-consuming journey which needs the help from the community of SoE.

The more people contribute, the earlier and better results.

But after all this is a free time project and developing tools or finding offset meanings needs hundreds, probably thousands of hours.

## Active Help
If the goal of this project isn't clear, make sure to have read the [goal](p?c=goal) first.

Assuming that you already did that, you might ask yourself what *you* can do.

### Comparing SRAMs

If so, you might want to join the SoE 'army', see [here](p?c=Contribute) how it works.

### Provide a localization

If you're speaking a language which this website currently doesn't offer but you think it should do, then consider offering a localization into your language as a huge contribution to this project. You might open access to people who cannot understand the supported languages well. If you're interested to add yourself to the contributors list click [here](mailto:evermore@xeth.de?subject=Format%20Exploration%20Project%20Localization)

### Passive Help
If that's not yours and just would like to see more capable SRAM editors in future, hey no big deal, that's ok.

* Propaganda

In that case you might want to tell your SoE friends about this project. 

Make it publicly known so crowd sourcing can start to kick in.

**Thank you!** 😊

Also **many thanks** to the people who [contributed](p?c=contributors) to this project.

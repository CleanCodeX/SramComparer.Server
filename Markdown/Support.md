# Supporting the Project

Finding the meaning of unknown SRAM pieces is a time-consuming journey which needs the help from the community of SoE.

The more people contribute, the earlier and better the results.

But after all this is a free time project and developing tools or finding offset meanings needs hundreds, probably thousands of hours.

## Active Help
If the goals of this project aren't clear yet, make sure to have read through the <a href=goals>goals</a> first.

Assuming that you already did that, you might ask yourself what *you* can do.

### Comparing SRAMs

If bits and bytes **are** your kind of thing, you might want to join the 'exploration army'. See <a href=Contribute>here</a> how it works.

### Provide a localization

If you're speaking a language which this website currently doesn't offer but you think it **should** do, then consider a localization into your language as a huge contribution to this project. You might open access to people who cannot understand the supported languages (well). If you want to get involved in the project, see <a href=localization>here</a> to do.

## Passive Help
If bits and bytes **aren't** your kind of thing, hey no big deal, that's OK.

If you just would like to see a poweful savegame editor in future then you might help with

* Propaganda

In that case you might want to tell your SoE friends about this project. 

Make it publicly known so crowd sourcing can start to kick in.

**Thank you!** 😊

Also **many thanks** to <a href=contributors>those</a> who already contributed to this project.

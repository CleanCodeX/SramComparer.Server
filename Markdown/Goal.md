### What's the Goal?
Once the SRAM format is completely known, it offers the possibility to write a full capable SRAM editor, enabling/disabling everything what can be controlled by a savegame.

"That sounds nice!" you probably say. (obviously we also think that)

#### What's still unknown?

A little less than 50% (about aprox. 400 bytes) of SoE's SRAM game slot format is still considered as 'unknown', meaning that we don't really know what these parts of SRAM actually do.

Most of unknown parts are reserved for pick-up information of various ingredient sniff spots, opened chests, gourds, pots and which persons were spoken to twice. Despite these there are also game relevant progress flags which we want to know to write more capable SRAM editors.

A non exhaustive list can be found under section [Unknowns](embed?p=Unknowns).

##### When will it be available?

Well, that's mostly up to the amount of contributions by the community.
We're spending our free time working on that, but that won't be enough to make it happen fast.

At this point you might ask yourself how you can make it happen faster. (likely I guess, due to the fact that you clicked on this page)

If you want to join the SoE army, see [here](embed?p=HowCanIHelp) how it works.

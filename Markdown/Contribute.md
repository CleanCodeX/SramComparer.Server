# Contributing to the project

## Is that possible?
Actually you can!

## What's the matter?
If the goals of this project aren't clear yet, make sure to have read through the <a href=goals>goals</a> first.

## Why
Finding the meaning of unknown SRAM pieces is a time-consuming journey which needs the help from the community of SoE.
Your help would save much time in not doing something twice what someone else already did.

The more people contribute, the earlier and better the results.

But after all this is a free time project and developing tools or finding offset meanings needs hundreds, probably thousands of hours.

## How to contribute
There are a view different ways of contributing to the project

#### Exploring SRAM data
First of all, it's not difficult to do that. There is a convenient tool which does the nasty work of comparison for you, meaning there is no need to use a hex-editor. Promised ;-)

If you're not **too** scared of bits and bytes, you could join the Exploration team. Check out <a href=explore>here</a> how it works.

However, if bits and bytes aren't your thing, that's fine too. You can contribute in other ways.

#### Localizing
Do you speak a language that this website doesn't currently offer but think you think it should be supported? 
In that case, you could consider a localization in your language. You could open this project up to people who only understand *your* language.

If you want to do that, Cool! Then check out <a href=localize>here</a>.

#### Advertising
